# inf553-adjusted-ratings
This repository is the project on "Yelp Recommendation Based on Aggregated Ratings from Sentiment and Stars" in class 
INF-553 at University of Southern California (USC). Our work attempts to combine the sentiment scores from the text content as well as their star ratings in order to create a new normalized rating value. This new rating will then be used in a collaborative filtering recommendation system which will be proven to recommend businesses that the previous system on solely stars would not.

## Sentiment Analysis

## Satistical Analysis

## New Scores

## Clustering
K-Means is planned to use to cluster the users based on the new adjusted stars and the original stars. The expected goal of clustering is to group the users that are similar based on adjusted rating in the same group and leave biased users on other different groups.
